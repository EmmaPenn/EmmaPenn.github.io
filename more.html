<h4> Learn More About My Favorite Books! </h4>

<p id = "desc"> Reading is one of my favorite hobbies! Reading is one of the main ways to escape from daily life and 
    I think everyone can benefit from reading. Reading has taught me so many things about growing up and was a 
    big support for me during COVID. Reading can be really underappreciated and undervalued and I think most people may not like reading because they have not found 
    the book for them yet. I think the best thing about reading is that even books written decades ago can be relatable to people everywhere today. For example, so many people still 
    love some of the classics like Frenkenstein by Mary Shelley or relate to books written by authors like Jane Austen! Some of my favorite genres include literary 
    fiction, fantasy, and science fiction. I am always willing to have a conversation 
    about books and love hearing your opinions on my favorite books (but beware if you disagree 
    with me as I may argue with you) especially literary fiction! Books were made to be shared and discussed, I encourage everyone to join a book club!
    If you want to keep up with my current reads or what 
    my thoughts were on the most recent books I have read feel free to check out my Goodreads.
