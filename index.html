    A little About Me:
    </p>


    

    <p id = "desc"> I am a current fourth-year Data Science and Health Science 
        Student at Northeastern Uniersity! As a DS/HS student I hope to 
        get more into using technology to help combat infectious disease 
        across the world and work towards effective treatments/vaccinations. Some possible passion 
        projects/skills I want to learn more about is a little bit of graphic design including things like figma. 
        Other than school, I enjoy reading new books, finding new cozy games, and running/going to the gym! 
        I've lived in Massachusetts my whole life! I grew up knowing I wanted to go into healthcare 
        and even entered college as pre-med until I took my first coding class where I learned 
        biostatistics in R programming language. I then switched my major to a combined major and 
        am now a Health Science and Data Science student. The combination of Data Science 
        and Health Science will hopefully allow me to help thousands across the world and be an innovator 
        in the combination of technology and medicine. I believe the cross between technology and healthcare has yet to reach its 
        peak and believe that it can be the solution for so many current conditions. In the future I hope to work with infectious disease 
        either globally or in the United States!

    Here's a photo of my dog Kam! I got him when I was 14 and he was just 3 months old. I love bringing him on hikes.
